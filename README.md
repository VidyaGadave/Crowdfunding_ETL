# Crowdfunding_ETL

Team mates : Vidya Gadave, Raymond Darrough

## Overview: 

In this mini project,
1. We are building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data.
2. After transforming this data, we have created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema.
3. After creating schema, we are loading these CSV file data into a Postgres database.
